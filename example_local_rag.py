            Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a revolutionary field of computer science that focuses on 
            creating intelligent machines capable of performing tasks that typically require human 
            intelligence. These tasks include learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and 
            language understanding. AI has applications across numerous industries including healthcare, 
            finance, transportation, and entertainment. Modern AI systems use machine learning 
            algorithms, neural networks, and deep learning to process vast amounts of data and make 
            intelligent decisions.

            Machine Learning (ML) is a core subset of artificial intelligence that enables computers 
            to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed for every task. 
            ML algorithms build mathematical models based on training data to make predictions or 
            decisions. There are three main types: supervised learning (learning from labeled examples), 
            unsupervised learning (finding patterns in unlabeled data), and reinforcement learning 
            (learning through trial and error with rewards). Popular ML techniques include decision 
            trees, support vector machines, neural networks, and ensemble methods.

            Natural Language Processing (NLP) is an exciting interdisciplinary field that combines 
            computer science, artificial intelligence, and linguistics to help computers understand,

            and interpret meaning. Common NLP applications include language translation, sentiment 
            analysis, chatbots, voice assistants, and text summarization. Modern NLP relies heavily 
            on transformer architectures, attention mechanisms, and large language models trained

            Deep Learning is a specialized branch of machine learning inspired by the structure and

            Deep learning has achieved remarkable success in computer vision, speech recognition, 
            natural language processing, and game playing. Key architectures include convolutional 
            neural networks (CNNs) for image processing, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for
